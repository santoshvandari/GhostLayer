Privacy Policy for GhostLayer

Last Updated: January 2026

1. Introduction
GhostLayer ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our Chrome Extension handles your data. The core philosophy of GhostLayer is Data Minimization we built this tool to protect your privacy, not invade it.

2. Data We Collect
We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data.
- No Accounts: You do not need to create an account to use GhostLayer.
- No Analytics: We do not use Google Analytics or any third-party tracking software in our extension.
- No Server: GhostLayer runs entirely on your local device (client-side). We do not have a backend server that receives your browsing history, passwords, or personal information.

3. Local Data Storage
We store the following data locally in your browser storage  to ensure the extension functions correctly:
- Preferences: Your settings for Fingerprint Spoofing, Data Poisoning, and other toggles.
- Email History: A local log of burner email addresses you have generated. This data never leaves your device.
- Statistics: Counters for "Trackers Poisoned" and "Emails Generated."
You can clear this data at any time by uninstalling the extension or clearing your browser's extension data.

4. Third-Party Services
GhostLayer interacts with the following third-party service solely to provide specific functionality:
- 1secmail.com: We use the [1secmail API](https://www.1secmail.com/) to generate temporary burner emails and fetch messages.
- Data Shared: When you generate an email or check your inbox, your request communicates directly with 1secmail's API. GhostLayer acts only as a bridge.
- Privacy: Please refer to [1secmail's Privacy Policy](https://www.1secmail.com/) for details on how they handle temporary email data.

5. Permissions Justification
We require specific browser permissions to function:
- `activeTab` & `<all_urls>`: Necessary to inject our "Fingerprint Spoofing" and "Data Poisoning" scripts into websites you visit to confuse trackers.
- `storage`: To save your settings locally.
- `alarms`: To schedule background tasks for data poisoning (random noise generation).

6. Children's Privacy
GhostLayer does not knowingly collect data from children under the age of 13. Since we collect no user data at all, this applies to all users regardless of age.

7. Changes to This Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
